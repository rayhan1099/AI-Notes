	- We exhaustively include every API call in TorchHub (94 API calls) and TensorHub (696 API calls); For HuggingFace, since the models come in a large number and lots of the models donâ€™t have a specification, we choose the most downloaded 20 models per task category (in a total of 925). We also generate 10 synthetic user question prompts per API using Self-Instruct [42].

Large Language Models as Tool Makers Attempts to remove the dependency on external tools by proposing a closed-loop framework, where LLMs create their own reusable tools for problem-solving. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17126](https://t.co/mEAaY2uIei)

Safety
- we know how to lock down code better?
