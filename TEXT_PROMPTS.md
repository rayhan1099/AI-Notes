- JSON
	- I've found LLMs to reliably return structured data via API by adding the system prompt: "Respond in the format of a JSON array [{key: value}, {key: value}]" Having an "unsure" option also reduces hallucination and indicates uncertainty.

- In [How Many Data Points is a Prompt Worth?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08493) (2021), ​​Scao and Rush found that a prompt is worth approximately 100 examples (caveat: variance across tasks and models is high – see image below). The general trend is that **as you increase the number of examples, finetuning will give better model performance than prompting**. There’s no limit to how many examples you can use to finetune a model.
	- A cool idea that is between prompting and finetuning is **[prompt tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08691)**, introduced by Leister et al. in 2021. Starting with a prompt, instead of changing this prompt, you programmatically change the embedding of this prompt. For prompt tuning to work, you need to be able to input prompts’ embeddings into your LLM model and generate tokens from these embeddings, which currently, can only be done with open-source LLMs and not in OpenAI API.

	- In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8 pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all about benchmarking.

## chain of thought prompting

authors found `Let's think step by step` quadrupled the accuracy, from 18% to 79%!

### Recursively Criticize and Improve

## Metaprompting

[Prompt Programming for Large Language Models: Beyond the Few-Shot Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07350.pdf)
- Q: What are Large Language Models?\n\n"
- "A good person to answer this question would be[EXPERT]\n\n"
- expert_name = EXPERT.rstrip(".\n")
- "For instance,{expert_name} would answer[ANSWER]"


https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05342.pdf
metaprompt stages:
1. comprehension clarification
2. preliminary judgment
3. critical evaluation
4. decision confirmation
5. confidence assessment

### halter methods

First, the authors add a 'halter' model that, after each inference step, is asked whether the inferences thus far are sufficient to answer the question. If yes, then the model generates a final answer.

The halter models brings a couple of advantages:

-   it can tell the selection-inference process to stop or keep going, as necessary.
-   if the process never halts, you'll get no answer, which is often preferable to a hallucinated guess

### least to most

Least-to-most prompting is another technique that splits up reasoning tasks into smaller, more reliable subtasks. The idea is to elicit a subtask from the model by prompting it with something like `To solve {question}, we need to first solve: "`. Then, with that subtask in hand, the model can generate a solution. The solution is appended to the original question and the process is repeated until a final answer is produced.

```
You are asked to come up with a set of 20 diverse task instructions. These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

Here are the requirements:
1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instrucitons.
3. The type of instructions should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of tasks like open-ended generation, classification, editing, etc.
2. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.
3. The instructions should be in English.
4. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
5. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.
6. Not all instructions require input. For example, when a instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necssary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.
7. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.

You are GPT-3, and you can't do math.

You can do basic math, and your memorization abilities are impressive, but you can't do any complex calculations that a human could not do in their head. You also have an annoying tendency to just make up highly specific, but wrong,
answers.

So we hooked you up to a Python 3 kernel, and now you can execute code. If anyone gives you a hard math problem, just use this format and we'll take care of the rest:

Question: ${Question with hard calculation.}
\```python
${Code that prints what you need to know}
\```

\```output
${Output of your code}
\```

Answer: ${Answer}

Otherwise, use this simpler format:

Question: ${Question without hard calculation} 
Answer: ${Answer}

Begin.
```

### `guess()` function

remove the `\```` escapes:

```python
import os
import openai
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
source = inspect.getsource (inspect.current frame())

def guess (what: str) -> str:
prompt = f"""\
Code:
\```
{source}
\```

Based on context, we could replace `guess({what!r})` with the string:
\```
"""

	return openai. Completion.create(
		prompt=prompt,
		stop="\\\"
		max_tokens=512,
		model="text-davinci-003",
		temperature=0,
	) ["choices"] [0] ["text"].strip()

# Test the guess function:
print(f"Apples are typically {guess('color')}.")
print (f"The drummer for The Beatles was {guess ('name')}.")
print("Pi is approximately {guess('pi')}, whereas e is approximately {guess('e')}.")
print (f"A paragraph-length explanation of the bubble sort would be: {guess('explanation')}")
