	- 1.  **GPT-4 is the master of all it surveys (for now),**¬†beating every other LLM on both classic benchmarks and exams designed to evaluate humans, validating the power of proprietary architectures and reinforcement learning from human feedback.
	1.  **Efforts are growing to try to clone or surpass proprietary performance,**¬†through smaller models, better datasets, and longer context. These could gain new urgency, amid concerns that human-generated data may only be able to sustain AI scaling trends for a few more years.
	    
	3.  **LLMs and diffusion models continue to drive real-world breakthroughs,**¬†especially in the life sciences, with meaningful steps forward in both molecular biology and drug discovery.
	    
	4.  **Compute is the new oil,**¬†with NVIDIA printing record earnings and startups wielding their GPUs as a competitive edge. As the US tightens its restrictions on trade restrictions on China and mobilizes its allies in the chip wars, NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD have started to sell export-control proof chips at scale.
	    
	5.  **GenAI saves the VC world, as amid a slump in tech valuations,**¬†AI startups focused on generative AI applications (including video, text, and coding), raised over $18 billion from VC and corporate investors.
	    
	6.  **The safety debate has exploded into the mainstream,**¬†prompting action from governments and regulators around the world. However, this flurry of activity conceals profound divisions within the AI community and a lack of concrete progress towards global governance, as governments around the world pursue conflicting approaches.
	    
	7.  **Challenges mount in evaluating state of the art models,**¬†as standard LLMs often struggle with robustness. Considering the stakes, as ‚Äúvibes-based‚Äù approach isn‚Äôt good enough.

			performance. We will make them the go-to solutions for most of the generative Al applications. Many of us played pivotal roles in
			important episodes in the development of LLMs; we're thrilled to be working together on new frontier models with a community-
			oriented mindset.
			In the coming months, Mistral Al will progressively and methodically release new models that close the performance gap between
			black-box and open solutions - making open solutions the best options on a growing range of enterprise use-cases.
			Simultaneously, we will seek to empower community efforts to improve the next generations of models."
		- Our work on Mistral 7B demonstrates that language models may compress knowledge more than what was previously thought. This opens up interesting perspectives: the field has so far put the emphasis on scaling laws in 2 dimensions (directly associating model capabilities to training cost) the problem is rather 3 dimensional (model capabilities, training cost, inference cost), and much remains to be explored to obtain the best performance with the smallest possible model.

    - They care about filtering, they care to some degree about direct lexical matches, they care about paging, getting groups / facet counts, etc.
    - Vectors, IMO, are just one feature that a regular search engine should have. IMO currently Vespa does the best job of this, though lately it seems Lucene (Elasticsearch and Opensearch) are really working hard to compete"
  - [Vespa.ai is spinning out of Yahoo as a separate company](https://blog.vespa.ai/vespa-is-becoming-its-own-company/) people speak highly of Vespa, it is targeting search and recsys problems rather than specifically vector db problems

    - the reports of ChatGPT having a liberal bias were a result of oversensitive prompts
    - GPT4 passing the bar exam and USMLE is a sign of contamination
      - "[OpenAI‚Äôs method to detect contamination is superficial and sloppy](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/gpt-4-and-professional-benchmarks)"

    - OnnxStream is based on the idea of decoupling the inference engine from the component responsible of providing the model weights, which is a class derived from¬†`WeightsProvider`. A¬†`WeightsProvider`¬†specialization can implement any type of loading, caching and prefetching of the model parameters. For example a custom¬†`WeightsProvider`¬†can decide to download its data from an HTTP server directly, without loading or writing anything to disk (hence the word "Stream" in "OnnxStream"). Two default¬†`WeightsProviders`¬†are available:¬†`DiskNoCache`¬†and¬†`DiskPrefetch`.

		- emergence (Wei et al) is still underappreciated
		- Perspective of "yet": "This idea doesn't work" -> "This idea doesn't work YET" 
			- Document experiments that failed because of insufficient ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù
			- Do not declare failure yet and make it easy to rerun in the future
			- As soon as the new model comes out, rerun them
			- Learn what works and what doesn‚Äôt
			- Update your intuition on emergent abilities and scale
		- We need post-training
			- instruction tuning - FLAN
			- Reward Model training
			- Policy model training
		- bitter lesson
			- Many Transformer variants have been proposed but almost all fancy variations don‚Äôt scale well
			- More useful to abstract away Transformer as sequence of functions and think about input and output shapes and types
