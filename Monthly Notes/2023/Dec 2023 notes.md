			- "Gemini is a large-scale science and engineering effort, requiring all kinds of different expertise in ML, distributed systems, data, evaluation, RL, fine-tuning, and more (800+ authors on the report).  The largest Gemini model was trained on a significant number of TPUv4 pods.   It is built on top of JAX and the Pathways system (https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12533), which enables us to orchestrate the large-scale training computation across a large number of TPUv4 pods across multiple data centers from a single Python process."
			- We have prepared a technical report about Gemini covering the model, training infrastructure, evaluations, safety analysis and responsible deployment.  I’ll walk you through some of the tables and figures in the report. https://deepmind.google/gemini/gemini_1_report.pdf

	- Finetuned Mistral 7B with a new C-RLFT technique
	- We propose the C(onditioned)-RLFT, which regards different data sources as coarse-grained reward labels and learns a class-conditioned policy to leverage complementary data quality information. Interestingly, the optimal policy in C-RLFT can be easily solved through single-stage, RL-free supervised learning, which is lightweight and avoids costly human preference labeling.

- [Magicoder: Source Code Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02120)
	- We introduce Magicoder, a series of fully open-source (code, weights, and data) Large Language Models (LLMs) for code that significantly closes the gap with top code models while having no more than 7B parameters. Magicoder models are trained on 75K synthetic instruction data using OSS-Instruct, a novel approach to enlightening LLMs with open-source code snippets to generate high-quality instruction data for code. 
	- The orthogonality of OSS-Instruct and other data generation methods like Evol-Instruct further enables us to build an enhanced MagicoderS. 
	- Notably, MagicoderS-CL-7B based on CodeLlama even surpasses the prominent ChatGPT on HumanEval+ (66.5 vs. 65.9 in pass@1). Overall, OSS-Instruct opens a new direction for low-bias and high-quality instruction tuning using abundant open-source references.

The large language model is capable of automatically generating keywords for text rendering and also supports layout modification through chatting.

The goal of LLM360 is to support open and collaborative AI research by making the end-to-end LLM training process transparent and reproducible by everyone. As a first step of LLM360, we release two 7B parameter LLMs pre-trained from scratch, Amber and CrystalCoder, including their training code, data, intermediate checkpoints, and analyses (at [this https URL](https://www.llm360.ai/)).

		- "I've tried nearly every provider (Replicate, Vertex, Modal), and the cost, cold boot, time to first token, and generation speed are all pretty far behind what you can get from the big providers. It's likely that none of them have the economies of scale the big guys do on one or two model flavors. When you can't saturate H200s on a single model, and are forced to serve multiple finetunes or run arbitrary code of off-the-shelf cloud offerings, you likely have huge inefficiencies that may never be surpassable."

This approach enables efficient inference with large language models (LLMs), achieving up to 20x compression with minimal performance loss. (examples in [the website](https://llmlingua.com))

		- Short term: use new benchmarks where they are available (AGIEval, GradQA, Hungarian Math) as a test of OOD generalisation instead of the gamed benchmarks. 
		- Medium-long term: need hidden test sets, and more datasets with fresh questions that do not have origins on some public site on the internet.
