	- phi-3-mini: 3.8B model trained on 3.3T tokens rivals Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5
	- phi-3-medium: 14B model trained on 4.8T tokens w/ 78% on MMLU and 8.9 on MT-bench
	- phi-3-mini achieves 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench
	- The mobile-friendly design is quantized to a 4-bit model, reducing its memory footprint to approximately 1.8GB
	- The innovation lies entirely in our dataset for training, a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2, composed of heavily filtered web data and synthetic data.
	- We also provide some initial parameter-scaling results with a 7B and 14B models trained for 4.8T tokens, called phi-3-small and phi-3-medium, both significantly more capable than phi-3-mini (e.g., respectively 75% and 78% on MMLU, and 8.7 and 8.9 on MT-bench)

	- 8 model sizes, including 0.5B, 1.8B, 4B, 7B, 14B, 32B and 72B dense models, and an MoE model of 14B with 2.7B activated;
	- Significant performance improvement in human preference for chat models;
	- Multilingual support of both base and chat models;
	- Stable support of 32K context length for models of all sizes

## open source tooling

- LMsys arena-hard: https://twitter.com/lmsysorg/status/1782179997622649330
	-  a pipeline to build our next generation benchmarks with live Arena data.
	- Significantly better separability than MT-bench (22.6% -> 87.4%)
	- Highest agreement to Chatbot Arena ranking (89.1%)
	- Fast & cheap to run ($25)
	- Frequent update with live data
	- We propose to use Confidence Intervals via Bootstrapping to calculate below two metrics:
	- Agreement with human: does benchmark have high agreement to human preference?
	- Separability: can benchmark confidently separate models?
	- Arena-hard achieves the highest on both, serving as a fast proxy to Chatbot Arena ranking.
	- How does Arena-hard pipeline work?
		1) Input: 200K Arena user prompts
		2) Topic modeling to ensure diversity 
		3) Key criteria (e.g., domain knowledge, problem-solving) to select high quality topic clusters
	1) Result: 500 challenging benchmark prompts.

	- [sonauto as well](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39992817): A more controllable AI music creator  
		- Others do music generation by training a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder like Descript Audio Codec (https://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec) to turn music into tokens, then training an LLM on those tokens. Instead, we ripped the tokenization part off and replaced it with a normal variational autoencoder bottleneck (along with some other important changes to enable insane compression ratios). This gave us a nice, normally distributed latent space on which to train a diffusion transformer (like Sora). Our diffusion model is also particularly interesting because it is the first audio diffusion model to generate coherent lyrics!
