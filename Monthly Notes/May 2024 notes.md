- [OpenAI's Preferred Publisher Program publisher partnerships deck](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40310228)
	- Additionally, members of the program receive priority placement and “richer brand expression” in chat conversations, and their content benefits from more prominent link treatments. Finally, through PPP, OpenAI also offers licensed financial terms to publishers.
	- The financial incentives participating publishers can expect to receive are grouped into two buckets: guaranteed value and variable value. Guaranteed value is a licensing payment that compensates the publisher for allowing OpenAI to access its backlog of data, while variable value is contingent on display success, a metric based on the number of users engaging with linked or displayed content.
	- Roughly 25% of ChatGPT users already use the browse function, but the company expects that a majority of users will do so once the feature is broadly rolled out. 
	- A representative for OpenAI disputed the accuracy of the information in the deck, which is more than three months old. The gen AI firm also negotiates deals on a per-publisher basis, rather than structuring all of its deals uniformly, the representative said.

- [LLM evaluation tools/vendors that really like that are useful in domain specific contexts? ](https://x.com/HamelHusain/status/1787944186714759419) 
	I'm looking for vendors that have ALL of the below:
	
	1. Observability
	2. Allow you to write your own assertions and LLM judges
	3. Bootsrap the creation of #2 automatically with LLMs
	4. Measure the alignment between humans (through an annotation queue) and capture critiques, also helping to generate more kinds of tests like #2
	5. Prompt, data and model versioning

	- centralized vs decentralized
	- Despite recent progress and endless cheerleading, open-source AI will become a financial drain for model builders, an inferior option for developers and consumers, and a risk to national security. Closed-source models will create far more economic and consumer value over the next decade.
