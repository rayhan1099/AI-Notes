harrison
- long term conversation memory and identiy



advice for founders
- harrison - keep it modular
	- easy to throw away
	- langchain isnt just a document wrapper around api, there are still document loaders and tools
		- no end to end stack because things move extremely fast
- build
	- plenty of whitespace
	- elad - more people should give up and move on

elad
- medpalm
	- outperforms experts
	- if doctor finetunes it gets worse (? source?)

tome - competing against msft/goog - how to stay ahead
- just ship faster than them, they show ads
- adept - does something interesting with enus
- what are they releasing is good enugh?

harrison
- chatpdf's are fine - expose data in more interesting way
- elad - a lot of people working on the UI

gaining developer adoption
- langchain - side project
- saw common abstractions and factored it out and offered as side project
- be nice to people
- build fast, use the more useful thing

elad - oportunities
- dont jump to advanced finetune
- people manage prompts in spreadsheets
- nobody has an eval framework yet 
- cost relative to model - 3.5 for other things
- scale
	- openai
	- jasper 
	- midjourney
	- notion
- we just had a tech discontinuity
	- not RNN world anymore

elad - if you can get away with bootstrapping why not
- advice to walk back on from High Growth Handbook

what to build
- tome: think about part of the job you hate/like - make AI tools 
- harrison: 
	- generative content - personalized for entertainment purposes
	- long term memory - who a user is

nat friedman andromeda - no comment

commonly held belief that you no longer hold
- if you had made the wrong bet - turbo - 6x on the compute with 5x the latency
- harrison - people think they want to finetune but dont need
	- tome guy agrees. more work to be done to make it different
	- stan from dustt - no GPUs before PMF
- elad - contrarian - not many proprietary useful dataset
	- focus on usecase and workflow, not data

tome guy
- collect data that helps you make better decisions

where will incumbents win?
- elad - 40% good will win because distribution
- have to build 10x better - no good incumbent

ui first?
- twitter vs bluesky/mastodon 
- copilot - everybdoy just copies it
- understated vs overstated
