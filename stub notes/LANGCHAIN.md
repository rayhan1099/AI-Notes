## good langchain tutorials

- https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langchain/
- **“[LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=260598607&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-92IYZXyQ6zjBdtzs2HLwWeFO1tbOWyI8WzPyu-MlVWiFgY0zIkdEye5ZILJgkSysE87XSRK-XbN1YMqdCj5bely54HUQ)”** taught by LangChain CEO Harrison Chase and me: LangChain is a powerful open-source tool for building applications using LLMs. Complex applications — for example, a QA (Question Answering) system to answer queries about a text document — require prompting an LLM multiple times, parsing the output to feed to downstream prompts, and so on; thus, there’s a lot of “glue” code needed. You’ll learn how to use LangChain’s tools to make these operations easy. We also discuss the cutting-edge (and  experimental) agents framework for using an LLM as a reasoning engine that can decide for itself what steps to take next, such as when to call an external subroutine._
